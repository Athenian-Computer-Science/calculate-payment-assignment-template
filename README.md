#  Calculate Payment


## Problem Description
Your goal is to make a payment calculator for your employees. No overtime is given (that's another assignment).

* The hourly rate is 15.25 dollars per hour. 
* You will need to prompt the user for their hours for the week.
    * Only whole numbers need to be considered for hours.
* Return the salary for the week.

## Example
```
Weekly hours? 10
returned salary: 152.50

Weekly hours? 40
returned salary: 610
```

## Suggested Approach
1) Prompt user for input (hours).
2) Create variable for rate.
3) Calculate salary based on hours and hourly rate.
4) Return salary.
5) Test your code by trying different hours worked. When it seems to work correctly, run pytest.

## Hints
* Pay close attention to data types!
